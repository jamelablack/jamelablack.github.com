    <h2>Amazon S3</h2>

<p>Amazon Simple Sotrogae Service is a great storage service websites where large amounts of data are required for you to upload your own content, such as images and videos and you users can upload content, as well.</p>

<p>There is a free plan for 5GB available and sign up is easy. Mac users who interact with S3 frequently tend to prefer client tools like Cyberduck or Transmit.</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2015</span>

    <h2>Securing Access for Different Actors</h2>

<p>In past, to secure access we would have created a before filter for each controller and specified the action - however, this can become cumbersome depending on the size of the app.</p>

<p>Instead, we can have our Admin::TodoController &lt; AdminsController and have AdminsController &lt; ApplicationController, moving our before filter from  Admin::TodoController to AdminsContollers</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AdminController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">before_filter</span> <span class="ss">:ensure_admin</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">ensure_admin</span>
    <span class="n">flash</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:error</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;You don&#39;</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">have</span> <span class="n">access</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">this</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">    redirect_to root_path unless current_user.admin?</span>
<span class="s2">  end</span>
<span class="s2">end</span></code></pre></div>

<h2>AuthenticatedController</h2>

<p>We can even take things one step further by creating an AuthenticatedController that can superclass the TodosController and AdminsController.</p>

<p>We need to ensure the user is logged in first:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#app/controllers/authenticated_controller.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AuthenticatedController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
  <span class="n">before_filter</span> <span class="ss">:ensure_sign_in</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<h2>Actor-Specific Controllers</h2>

<p>It&#39;s very common to have several types to actors within an application and features specific to the public. To manage this, it&#39;s best to have actor-specfic controllers and then subclass one another. This allows you to compartentalize actions for actors easily.</p>

      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2015</span>

    <h2>Actors</h2>

<p>Actors are different types of users, most likely referred to as admins, becasue they act differently within your application.</p>

<p>In some instances, you could:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span>
  <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">current_user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">admin?</span>
    <span class="no">Todo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span>
    <span class="k">else</span> <span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">.</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But dependeing on the size, this could be quite cumbersome.</p>

<p>Another alternative, is we can create a seperate action:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">admin_index</span>
  <span class="vi">@todos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Todo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The advatange is that everything the admin can do is seperate from the other actors. But this is also cumbersome b/c if we have multiple actors, before each action, we have to check the users role.</p>

<h2>Namespace</h2>

<p>So instead, we are going to work with Namespaces.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#routes.rb</span>
<span class="n">resources</span> <span class="ss">:todos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">only</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:index</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:create</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:new</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:show</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="ss">:admin</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">resources</span> <span class="ss">:todos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">only</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:index</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The above route would give us:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="sr">//</span><span class="ss">localhost</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">3000</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">admin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">todos</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So, therefore your controller would be in app/controllers/admin/todos<em>controller, rather than app/controllers/todos</em>controller</p>

<p>Add when created, our class name is prefixed with the module Admin</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Admin</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">TodosController</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>We also need to run a migration to add the admin column to the users table</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">rails</span> <span class="n">g</span> <span class="n">migration</span> <span class="n">add_admin_to_users</span></code></pre></div>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">AddAdminToUsers</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">ActiveRecord</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Migration</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">change</span>
    <span class="n">add_column</span> <span class="ss">:users</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:admin</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:boolean</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Our viewv template in this case would be in:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">views</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">admin</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">haml</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This layout allows us to add things like an admin dashboard</p>

    <h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>

<h4>Excerpt from Tealeaf:</h4>

<p>Continuous Delivery (CD) or sometimes known as Continuous Deployment goes one step beyond CI to automatically deploy features when the new code passes the continuous integration phase. Continuous Delivery encourages small and incremental software updates over big and infrequent releases to shorten the feedback loop and fix bugs earlier.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at an example development workflow that has both CI and CD enabled, based on the Github Flow process:</p>

<p>** we pull the latest code from Github
** we create a new feature branch and develop a new feature
** after we finish the feature, we push it to a branch with the same name on Github
** we create a PR from this branch to the staging branch.
** we wait for the the CI server to ensure all tests pass.
** we allow the CI server to automatically deploy the code from the staging branch to our staging server
** we perform sanity tests on our staging server
** we create a PR from the staging branch to the master branch on Github
** this will trigger another round of integration and if it passes, the CI server will automatically deploy the code to the production server.</p>

<p>If adopted by everyone in the development team, this process will make sure our master branch is always in sync with the production server and new features are also always build on top of what&#39;s on the production server.</p>

<p>Assignment: Set up Continuous Delivery with Circle CI</p>

<p>For this assignment, you are going to enable Continuous Delivery with Circle CI.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<p>create a staging branch locally if you don&#39;t have it yet.
in Circle CI, follow Project settings for your project and select Heroku Deployment under Continuous Deployment
configure the Heroku API key. (Get it from your Heroku account page)
associate Heroku SSH key with your Circle account so Circle can have the authority to deploy to Heroku on your behalf.
create a circle.yml file in your projects root directory and make sure your adjust production<em>app</em>name &amp; staging<em>app</em>name to your own app name.
Here is an example of a circle.yml file that you can use:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">machine</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p>This code should be pretty self explanatory - this allows Circle to monitor your staging branch and deploy to the staging server, and monitor your master branch to deploy to the production server. It&#39;ll run migrations for you and for the production server, it also automatically backs up the database before a deploy.</p>

<p>Notifications Options</p>

<p>By default we will be notified by email on every status change of our builds. But receiving emails all the time build fails or passes might be cumbersome and there are also good alternatives.</p>

<p>For Mac users - there is a free application CCMenu by ThoughtWorks which we install and it will stick to our upper bar. In order to make it fully run - we will need to generate a CircleCI API key (Project settings -&gt; API keys) and http address of build. See the setup info guide here. Great feature of this app is that it can play sounds based on build&#39;s status and we are able to customize it to our needs.</p>

<p>Another great feature most CIs offer are Embedded Status Badges. These are especially useful for open source projects. They look nice in README.md usually placed in GitHub repo page giving out the information about build being successful or not.</p>

    <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

<p>According to Martin Fowler&#39;s <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">blog</a>, Continuous Integration is
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. This article is a quick overview of Continuous Integration summarizing the technique and its current usage.</p>

<h4>According to Tealeaf...</h4>

<p>The problem that CI solves is to force integration on a regular basis. For example, you may have just finished a feature on my_feature branch and have had all the tests pass locally. You open a PR and your fellow coworkers are happy with the way the code looks. Github shows the PR can be automatically merged without conflict - so you do that, merge it back to the master branch and ready to deploy the feature!</p>

<p>The danger of this workflow is that while you are working on your feature, someone else could have just finished their feature and pushed to the master branch to Github, and your new feature never integrated with this new piece of code.</p>

<p>A Continuous Integration solution would watch your repository and force integration (running the entire test suite on the CI server) whenever necessary.</p>

<p>Once we have our CI server set up to monitor our repository, it&#39;ll pull the latest code and run the entire test suite every time we push code to any branch on Github (when you work with a CI server, you want to make sure that every push should always make the tests pass) and notify you on the results. The CI server also runs every time we merge our pull request to the master branch to ensure integration.</p>

<p>CI server helps us catch integration errors before they reach to production, and the earlier we catch errors, the less costly we can fix them.</p>

<p>A CI solution doesn&#39;t eliminate the necessity to run your tests locally - your will lose friends quickly if you constantly push code that &quot;breaks the build&quot; and have everyone notified. However, in cases of long running test suites, it is acceptable to run only the tests pertaining to the new feature built, and have the CI server to run the entire test suite to catch any potential regression. Most modern CI services allow you to run the tests in parallel (with a paid plan, typically) so it could run your tests several times faster.</p>

<h3>Circle CI</h3>

<h3>Set Up Continuous Integration with Circle CI</h3>

<p><a href="http://circleci.com">Circle CI</a> is a popular Continuous Integration service. Set up your project with Circle CI is pretty simple - link and authorize your Github account, then add the repository that you want to enable CI. By default, Circle CI runs on every push and PR merge.</p>
