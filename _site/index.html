    <h2>Magic Tricks of Testing</h2>

<p>We want unit tests to be
*Thorough
*Stable
*Fast
*Few</p>

<p>Focus on Messages
Objects are simple-minded.</p>

<p>Message Origin
Objects under test have three message origin options:
*1. Incoming Messages
*2. Outgoing Messages
*3. Messages sent to self (messages that are completely contained inside the object and are unknown to the outside)</p>

<p>Message Type
*1. Query - returns something, changes nothing (addition method)
*2. Command - returns something, changes something (save method)</p>

<p>We often times conflate commands and queries (like .(pop))</p>

<p>Rules of the Unit Test Minimalist
INCOMING QUERY MESSAGES</p>

<ol>
<li>Test Incoming Query Messages by making assetions about what the send back. Makes an assertion about a value (state). Here we want to test the interface and not the implementation. If we just care about what value is returned and not how we get there... then I can change the code without breaking it.</li>
</ol>

<p>INCOMING COMMAND MESSAGES
2. Test incoming command messages by making assertions about direct public side effects. Direct means its the responsibility of the last ruby class invloved. You&#39;re making an assertion on the new value as result of calling that command.</p>

<p>Key Takeway - The receiver of incoming messages has the sole responsibility of asserting the result direct public side effect. This is the sole place where we are making an assertions about values, testing the value of the thing returned</p>

<p>MESSAGES SENT TO SELF</p>

<p>Private Methods - Don&#39;t test private methods. Don&#39;t make assertiond about their result. Do not expect to send them. Doing so will add no value to your tests and will make it impossible to change in the future wihthout breaking something. They also discourage other devs from touching your code so you may want to add the comment &quot;if these tests fail, delete them.&quot;</p>

<p>Caveat: Break rule if itk saves $$$ during development.</p>

<p>Key Takeway - Ignore them.</p>

<p>OUTGOING QUERY MESSAGES
Making assertions on query messages is the job of the reciever. Therefore making an assertion on outgoing messages is redundant and should be avoided. It makes your tests are break when there is a change and it is very combersome to understand what going on. It adds no value.</p>

<p>Rule: Do not test outgoing query messages. Do not make assertions about their result. Do not epxect to send them.</p>

<p>You will notice that both tests made to self and tech on outgoing query messages have the same rule, don&#39;t do them. This is because they have no visbible side effects, they are invisible to the rest of your application and their tests add no value.</p>

<p>Rule: If a message has no visible side-effects, the sender should not test it.</p>

<p>OUTGOING COMMAND MESSAGES
Outgoing command messages must be sent, they have to be sent or the app will not be correct. Testing, however the distant side effects of sending the message is an integration test. Asserting that the state of a thing changed in the database is not job of the outgoing command message. It&#39;s job is ensure that a message is sent. Asserting that some change has occured or making an assertion about the state of the DB will forever connect you to that result and the objects.. even those distant involved.</p>

<p>Testing that a message was sent requires a mock. Testing this way makes a bet that the edge (the API...the message sent) is more stable than the distant side effect and the path to it.</p>

<p>Rule: Test outgoing command messages by setting expectations on them being sent. Caveat: Break Rule if ide effects are stable and cheap... and close. The further away - the worse.</p>

<p>Rule: It is our job to ensure that mocks honor their contract. Ensure test doubles stay insync with the API</p>

<p>Gems that help you manage your mocks:
*Bogus
*Quacky
*Rspec-Fire
*Minitest-Firemock</p>

    <h2>Further Reading</h2>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">blog post</a> by Martin Fowler. Here is an excert I found valuable:</p>

<p>Meszaros uses the term Test Double as the generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes. The name comes from the notion of a Stunt Double in movies. (One of his aims was to avoid using any name that was already widely used.) Meszaros then defined four particular kinds of double:</p>

<p>Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
*Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).
*Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what&#39;s programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it &#39;sent&#39;, or maybe only how many messages it &#39;sent&#39;.
*Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
Of these kinds of doubles, only mocks insist upon behavior verification. The other doubles can, and usually do, use state verification.</p>

    <p>In previous lessons, extracted some of our logic into policy, domain and service objects. We can now update our TodosController spec to reflect these new objects, but we don&#39;t have to test the functionality of the service level object, for example - we just to make sure that the object can respond to the actions extracted to the Service Level process. We can accomplish this with mocking &amp; stubbing. Ensuring that a message has been sent and the object can respond to that message. We are not concerned with the response for that message.</p>

<p>So far with stubbing (which is all we have done up until this point), we have always been asserting on values or the state of the system. With mocking, we asserting on communication. Mocks will always be in unit testing becasue you ar stubbing out your collaborators. If you have to create too many mocks, then you know that you are missing another layer of abstraction. Limiting your spec to focusing on one object allows you code smells like these.</p>

<p>Picking up from our last example, we would create a mock with the following. Please note that the trigger is after the assertion:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;delegates to CreditDeduction to deduct credit&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

    <p>Rails provides an MVC framework - but there is a point where the complexity of your application grows beyong this structure. Typically, when this first happens, devs move the logic from their controllers, to the models (skinny contollers/fat models) - but often we find that we are pushing too much logic into the models, making them bloated. Often times models at the center of your application, that are so large (in complexity and touches so many other objects) that people are afraid to touch it (becasue something bad will happen if you mess up) is called God Objects (God Models).</p>

<h2>Object Composition</h2>

<p>We can take some of the responsibility from those objects however, this does come at a cost.</p>

<h4>In-direction</h4>

<p>When you extract logic to various objects within a process, it can be difficult to chase down what is happening as the process is not all in one view. Well defined names and interfaces.</p>

<p>However - there are some ways to abuse object composition.</p>

<h3>YAGNI (You Aren&#39;t Going to Need It)</h3>

<p>is over-extracting or abstracting to a layer that is not useful at the moment, in hopes that it will be in the future, but you prolly won&#39;t. It is better to wait as you will never know less about the future than you do now.</p>
