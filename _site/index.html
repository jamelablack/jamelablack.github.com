    <h3>1. Pull Up Method</h3>

<p>You have methods with identical results on subclasses. Move them to the superclass.</p>

<h3>2.Push Down Method</h3>

<p>Behavior on a superclass is relevant only for some of its subclasses. Move it to those subclasses</p>

<h3>3. Extract Module</h3>

<p>You have duplicated behavior in two or more classes.
Create a new module and move the relevant behavior from the old class into the module, and include the module in the class.</p>

<h3>4. Inline Module</h3>

<p>The resultant indirection of the included module is no longer worth the duplication it is preventing.
Merge the module into the including class.</p>

<h3>5. Extract Subclass</h3>

<p>A class has features that are used only in some instances.
Create a subclass for that subset of features.</p>

<h3>6. Introduce Inheritance</h3>

<p>You have two classes with similar features.
Make one of the classes a superclass and move the common features to the superclass.</p>

<h3>7. Collapse Hierarchy</h3>

<p>A superclass and subclass (or module and the class that includes the module) are not very different.
￼￼Merge them together</p>

<h3>8. Form Template Method</h3>

<p>You have two methods in subclasses that perform similar steps in the same order, yet the steps are different.
Get the steps into methods with the same signature, so that the original methods become the same. Then you can pull them up.</p>

<h3>9. Replace Inheritance with Delegation</h3>

<p>A subclass uses only part of a superclass interface or does not want to inherit data.
Create a field for the superclass, adjust methods to delegate to the superclass, and remove the subclassing.
￼Replace Inheritance with Delegation</p>

<h3>10. Replace Abstract Superclass with Module</h3>

<p>You have an inheritance hierarchy, but never intend to explicitly instantiate an instance of the superclass.
Replace the superclass with a module to better communicate your intention.</p>

        Refactoring - Simplifying Conditional Expressions

    <h3>1. Decompose Condtional</h3>

<p>You have a complicated conditional (if-then-else) statement.
Extract methods from the condition, “then” part, and “else” parts.
Mechanics
*<em>1. Extract the condition into its own method.
*</em>2. Extract the “then” part and the “else” part into their own methods.</p>

<h3>2. Recompose Conditional</h3>

<p>You have conditional code that is unnecessarily verbose and does not use the most readable Ruby construct.
Replace the conditional code with the more idiomatic Ruby construct.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">before</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">parameters</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span> <span class="p">?</span> <span class="n">params</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">[]</span>

<span class="ss">after</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">parameters</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">params</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">[]</span></code></pre></div>

<h3>3. Consolidate Conditional Expression</h3>

<p>You have a sequence of conditional tests with the same result.
Combine them into a single conditional expression and extract it.</p>

<h3>4. Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments</h3>

<p>The same fragment of code is in all branches of a conditional expression.
Move it outside the expression.</p>

<h3>5. Replace Condtional with Polymorphism</h3>

<p>Motivation
One of the grandest sounding words in object jargon is polymorphism. The essence of polymorphsim is that it allows you to avoid writing an explicit con- ditional when you have objects whose behavior varies depending on their types.
As a result you find that case statements or if-then-else statements that switch on type codes are much less common in an Object-Oriented program.</p>

<p>Polymorphism gives you many advantages. The biggest gain occurs when this same set of conditions appears in many places in the program. If you want to add a new type, you have to find and update all the conditionals. But with polymorphism you just create a new class and provide the appropriate methods. Clients of the class don’t need to know about the polymorphism, which reduces the dependencies in your system and makes it easier to update.</p>

<p>Ruby’s duck typing makes it easy to introduce polymorphism. In a statically typed language like Java, you need inheritance or implementation of an inter- face to be able to call a method polymorphically. But in Ruby, an object’s cur- rent set of methods—not its inheritance from a particular class—determines its valid semantics. So long as objects A and B have the same method, you can call them in the same way.</p>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<p>Polymorphism in Ruby can be achieved in a couple of ways. In its simplest form, you can implement the same method signature on multiple objects and call these methods polymorphically. You can introduce a module hierarchy and have the method that is to be called polymorphically on the module. Or you can introduce an inheritance hierarchy and have the method that is to be called polymorphically on the subclasses. In each case, the mechanics are the same.
The code you target may be a case statement or an if statement.</p>

<p>*<em>1. If the conditional statement is one part of a larger method, take apart the
conditional statement and use Extract Method.
*</em>2. If necessary use Move Method to place the conditional at the appropriate place in the object structure.
**3. Pick one of the polymorphic objects. Create a method on the polymor- phic object that will override the conditional statement method. Copy the body of that leg of the conditional statement into the polymorphic method and adjust it to fit.</p>

<h3>6. Introuduce a Null Object</h3>

<p>You have repeated checks for a nil value.
Replace the nil value with a null object.</p>

<p>The essence of polymorphism is that instead of asking an object what type it is and then invoking some behavior based on the answer, you just invoke the behavior. The object, depending on its type, does the right thing. One of the less intuitive places to do this is where you have a null value in a field.</p>

        Refactoring - Simple Method Calls
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2015</span>

    <h3>1.. Rename Method</h3>

<p>The name of a method does not reveal its purpose.
Change the name of the method.</p>

<h3>2. Add Parameter</h3>

<p>A method needs more information from its caller.
Add a parameter for an object that can pass on this information.</p>

<h3>3. Remove Parameter</h3>

<p>A parameter is no longer used by the method body.
Remove it.</p>

<h3>4. Seperate Query from Modifier</h3>

<p>You have a method that returns a value and also changes the state of an object.
Create two methods, one for the query and one for the modification.</p>

<h3>4. Parameterize Method</h3>

<p>You have a method that returns a value and also changes the state of an object.
Create two methods, one for the query and one for the modification.</p>

<p>Motivation
You may see a couple of methods that do similar things but vary depending on a few values. In this case you can simplify matters by replacing the separate methods with a single method that handles the variations by parameters. Such a change removes duplicate code and increases flexibility, because you can deal with other variations by adding parameters.</p>

<h3>5. Perserve Whole Object</h3>

<p>You are getting several values from an object and passing these values as param- eters in a method call.
Send the whole object instead.</p>

<h3>6. Replace Parameter with Method</h3>

<p>An object invokes a method, then passes the result as a parameter for a method. The receiver can also invoke this method.
Remove the parameter and let the receiver invoke the method.</p>

<h3>7. Introduce Parameter Object</h3>

<p>You have a group of parameters that naturally go together.
Replace them with an object.</p>

<h3>8. Remove Setting Method</h3>

<p>A field should be set at creation time and never altered.
Remove any setting method for that field.
Providing a setting method indicates that a field may be changed. If you don’t want that field to change once the object is created, don’t provide a setting method. That way your intention is clear and you often remove the possibility that the field will change.</p>

<h3>9. Hide Method</h3>

<p>A method is not used by any other class.
Make the method private.</p>

<h3>10. Replace Constructor with Factory Method</h3>

<p>You want to do more than simple construction when you create an object.
Replace the constructor with a factory method.
The most obvious motivation for Replace Constructor with Factory Method is when you have conditional logic to determine the kind of object to create. If you need to do this conditional logic in more than one place, it’s time for a Factory Method.</p>

<h3>11.Replace Error Code with Exception</h3>

<p>A method returns a special code to indicate an error.
Raise an exception instead.</p>

<h3>12. Replace Exception with Test</h3>

<p>You are raising an exception on a condition the caller could have checked first.
Change the caller to make the test first.
Exceptions are an important advance in programming languages. They allow us to avoid complex codes by use of Replace Error Code with Exception. Like so many pleasures, exceptions can be used to excess, and they cease to be pleasur- able. Exceptions should be used for exceptional behavior: behavior that is an unexpected error. They should not act as a substitute for conditional tests. If you can reasonably expect the caller to check the condition before calling the operation, you should provide a test, and the caller should use it.</p>

<h3>13. Introduce Gateway</h3>

<p>You want to interact with a complex API of an external system or resource in a simplified way.
Introduce a Gateway that encapsulates access to an external system or resource.</p>

<h3>14. Introduce Expression Builder</h3>

<p>You want to interact with a public interface in a more fluent manner and not muddy the interface of an existing object.
Introduce an Expression Builder and create an interface specific to your application.
￼Introduce Expression Builder
￼￼</p>

    <h3>1. Self Encapsulated Field</h3>

<p>You are accessing a field directly, but the coupling to the field is becoming awkward.
Create getting and setting methods for the field and use only those to access the field.</p>

<h3>2. Replace Data Value with Object</h3>

<p>You have a data item that needs additional data or behavior.
Turn the data item into an object:
*<em>1. Create the class for the value. Give it an equivalent field to the field in the source class. Add an attribute reader and a constructor that takes the field as an argument.
*</em>2. Change the attribute reader in the source class to call the reader in the new class.</p>

<h3>3. Change Value to Reference</h3>

<p>You have a class with many equal instances that you want to replace with a single object.
Turn the object into a reference object.</p>

<h3>4. Change Reference to Value</h3>

<p>You have a reference object that is small, immutable, and awkward to manage. Turn it into a value object.</p>

<h3>5. Replace Array with Object</h3>

<p>You have an Array in which certain elements mean different things. Replace the Array with an object that has a field for each element.
*<em>1. Create a new class to represent the information in the Array. Give it a method called [] so that callers that read the Array can be changed one by one. Give it a method called []= so that callers that write to the Array can be changed one by one.
*</em>2. Construct the new object wherever the Array was instantiated.</p>

<h3>6. Replace Hash with Object</h3>

<p>You have a Hash that stores several different types of objects, and is passed around and used for more than one purpose.
Replace the Hash with an object that has a field for each key.</p>

<p>*<em>1. Create a new class to represent the information in the Hash. Give it a method called [] so that callers that read the Hash can be changed one by one. Give it a method called []= so that callers that write to the Hash can be changed one by one.
*</em>2. Construct the new object wherever the Hash was instantiated.</p>
