  <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2015</span>
  <h3>1. Self Encapsulated Field</h3>

<p>You are accessing a field directly, but the coupling to the field is becoming awkward.
Create getting and setting methods for the field and use only those to access the field.</p>

<h3>2. Replace Data Value with Object</h3>

<p>You have a data item that needs additional data or behavior.
Turn the data item into an object:
*<em>1. Create the class for the value. Give it an equivalent field to the field in the source class. Add an attribute reader and a constructor that takes the field as an argument.
*</em>2. Change the attribute reader in the source class to call the reader in the new class.</p>

<h3>3. Change Value to Reference</h3>

<p>You have a class with many equal instances that you want to replace with a single object.
Turn the object into a reference object.</p>

<h3>4. Change Reference to Value</h3>

<p>You have a reference object that is small, immutable, and awkward to manage. Turn it into a value object.</p>

<h3>5. Replace Array with Object</h3>

<p>You have an Array in which certain elements mean different things. Replace the Array with an object that has a field for each element.
*<em>1. Create a new class to represent the information in the Array. Give it a method called [] so that callers that read the Array can be changed one by one. Give it a method called []= so that callers that write to the Array can be changed one by one.
*</em>2. Construct the new object wherever the Array was instantiated.</p>

<h3>6. Replace Hash with Object</h3>

<p>You have a Hash that stores several different types of objects, and is passed around and used for more than one purpose.
Replace the Hash with an object that has a field for each key.</p>

<p>*<em>1. Create a new class to represent the information in the Hash. Give it a method called [] so that callers that read the Hash can be changed one by one. Give it a method called []= so that callers that write to the Hash can be changed one by one.
*</em>2. Construct the new object wherever the Hash was instantiated.</p>
