<p>Generalization or Trianglization:
Writing general code</p>

<h2>Red-Green Refactor</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing Tests to Fail and then refactor your code to pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time - only write enough code to get an different error message.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TDD is a discipline for writing code, writing developer (unit) tests, and doing design work in an integrated approach. A useful mnemonic for remembering the basic TDD cycle is &quot;red &gt; green &gt; refactor.&quot; Here is a short summary of each of the steps.</p>

<h3>RED</h3>

<p>Start by thinking of a behavior you want the software to have which could be implemented by a few lines of code (fewer than five is a good target). Then write a test (also only a few lines of code) that will fail unless that behavior is present.</p>

<h3>GREEN</h3>

<p>Write just enough code to get the test to pass. Focus on: Getting something to work. Simplest possible implementation, rather than the most elegant solution (even hard-coded values are okay).</p>

<h3>REFACTOR</h3>

<p>Now that the code does what you want, use refactoring to make the design right. Making the code readable and eliminating duplication.</p>

<p>The cycle then repeats with each new behavior you want to have. The entire cycle should take between 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>A couple of last points to emphasize:</p>

<p>Tests are checked in with the rest of the code (they are essentially living documentation of the code)
Tests are run with every build</p>
