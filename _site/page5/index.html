    <p>Generalization or Trianglization:
Writing general code</p>

<h2>Red-Green Refactor</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Writing Tests to Fail and then refactor your code to pass.</p></li>
<li><p>Each time - only write enough code to get an different error message.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>TDD is a discipline for writing code, writing developer (unit) tests, and doing design work in an integrated approach. A useful mnemonic for remembering the basic TDD cycle is &quot;red &gt; green &gt; refactor.&quot; Here is a short summary of each of the steps.</p>

<h3>RED</h3>

<p>Start by thinking of a behavior you want the software to have which could be implemented by a few lines of code (fewer than five is a good target). Then write a test (also only a few lines of code) that will fail unless that behavior is present.</p>

<h3>GREEN</h3>

<p>Write just enough code to get the test to pass. Focus on: Getting something to work. Simplest possible implementation, rather than the most elegant solution (even hard-coded values are okay).</p>

<h3>REFACTOR</h3>

<p>Now that the code does what you want, use refactoring to make the design right. Making the code readable and eliminating duplication.</p>

<p>The cycle then repeats with each new behavior you want to have. The entire cycle should take between 5-10 minutes.</p>

<p>A couple of last points to emphasize:</p>

<p>Tests are checked in with the rest of the code (they are essentially living documentation of the code)
Tests are run with every build</p>

        Build Robust & Production Quality Applications - Lesson 1: From Test Later to Test Driven
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Jan 2015</span>

    <h2>There are several ways to integrate testing into your workflow:</h2>

<h4>1. Code First, Test Later</h4>

<p>Benefit: Guard against regression</p>

<h4>2. Code a Little, Test a Little</h4>

<p>Benefit: Feedback loop is shorter</p>

<h4>3. Test First Development</h4>

<p>Where you write the test first, run it and make sure it fails then after which you write the code to
make it pass. It challenges to think about your expected result upfront and you&#39;re able to lock in your behavior
while working towards that</p>

<h4>4. Test Driven Development (TDD)</h4>

<p>Test, not only to test with an expected result in mind but you write test to interactively build up (drive out) your
implementation code.
Benefit: people normally gravitate towards TDD, when they have an end goal that is complex in nature so they start
with the simple and build up on complexity gradually.</p>

<h4>5. Test Driven Design (TDDe)</h4>

<p>Similar to Test Driven Development, except TDD is more logic and locally focused. while TDDe is more
expanding to the system level, more focused on the architecture (the interaction or collaboration b/w components in
your system - describing the interactions b/w various objects)</p>

    <p>How to create a branch and checkout at the same time:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">checkout</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">b</span> <span class="n">mod3</span></code></pre></div>

<ol>
<li>Anything in the master branch is deployable</li>
<li>To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)</li>
<li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server</li>
<li>When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request</li>
<li>After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master</li>
<li>Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately</li>
</ol>

        Build Robust & Production Quality Applications - Lesson 1: First test in Rspec
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2015</span>

    <ol>
<li>Add Rspec to your gemfile, make sure to include in both test and development:</li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">group</span> <span class="ss">:test</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:development</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rspec-rails&#39;</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<ol>
<li>rails g rspec:install</li>
</ol>

<p>Generates three items:
  1. .rspec file - contains &quot;color&quot;.. just means you want your output to be color-coded
  2. spec folder
  3. spec helper - where configuration goes</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create models folder inside spec folder</p></li>
<li><p>Create a todo_spec.rb within the models folder (name of model)</p></li>
<li><p>Within todo_spec.rb you must:</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;spec_helper&#39;</span>

  <span class="n">describe</span> <span class="no">Todo</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">&quot;saves itself&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
      <span class="n">todo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Todo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;cook dinner&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">description</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;love me some din din&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

      <span class="no">Todo</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">should</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;cook dinner&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div>

<p>** &quot;it&quot; is a keyword that begins each test</p>

<p>** &quot;do&quot; implements the test</p>

<p>** .should is another keyword will test to see if we have the desired result.</p>

<p>** == is the matcher</p>

<h2>How to run rspec outside of Rails</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a project folder</li>
<li>Inside the project folder, create a lib folder. Your code that you&#39;re testing will go inside here.</li>
<li>Create another folder: spec, where your .spec test files will go.</li>
<li>Make sure to require your code files inside your specs.</li>
</ol>

        Build Robust & Production Quality Applications - Lesson 1: Unit vs. Functional vs. Integration Tests

    <h3>There are 3 types of tests:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Unit</li>
<li>Functional</li>
<li>Integration</li>
</ol>

<h3>Ranking according to:</h3>

<h4>Coverage:</h4>

<p>Unit &gt; Functional &gt; Integration</p>

<h4>Speed:</h4>

<p>Unit &gt; Functional &gt; Integration</p>

<h4>Realistic:</h4>

<p>Integration &gt; Functional &gt; Unit</p>

<h3>1) Unit Tests</h3>

<ul>
<li>testing a component in isolation, focusing on 1 thing and making sure all cases are covered</li>
<li>isolated components tested: routes, models, views, helpers</li>
<li>allow you to thoroughly test all components.. as it is the closest to the code.</li>
<li>is the fastest and gives you the best coverage</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Functional Tests</h3>

<ul>
<li>testing components in collaboration, making sure not only they work but that they play nicely with each other</li>
<li>components tested: controllers (where everything interacts), typically once request/response cycle</li>
</ul>

<h3>3) Integration Tests</h3>

<p>Builds upon functional tests in the sense that not only must play nicely together but they must achieve a desired business objective.</p>

<ul>
<li>Components tested: Goal is to emulate the user, typically occurs in browser and follows the entire business process and
that the business objective is achieved</li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple styles of testing.. it has become very much like an &quot;art&quot; as devs often times develop a taste of styles for what to test, when, etc. In this course, we will primarily write unit and functional tests leaving integration tests for important business workflows.</p>
