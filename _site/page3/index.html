        My name is Jam, and I am a Rails Developer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Aug 2014</span>

    <p>This is my path to becoming a Ruby on Rails Developer. I first was exposed to code back in June 2013, after attending a Rails Girls Workshop in Washington, DC. At that workshop, a very notable leader in the Ruby community, <a href="http://www.sandimetz.com/">Sandi Metz</a> gave a talk on <a href="http://en.wikipedia%20org/wiki/Grit_%28personality_trait%29">grit</a>. Up until that point, I thought that being a developer was reserved for those with computer science majors and or mathmeticians. But her talk, gave me some sort of hope that if I worked hard enough, becoming a developer was possible. So with that, I set on my journey of being a self taught developer. One thing that I have learned in this process, learning to code is circular.. not linear. Often times, it may require seeing a concept 3 or 4 times before you can tackle it without googling the concept.. and what I&#39;ve had to learn is that is okay. I had to let go the idea that I wasn&#39;t going to remember everything but with experience.. I could figure it out or at least know resources to leverage to find my answer. This blog is to document concepts that I&#39;ve learned becasue I am bound to forget.. and that&#39;s okay. In case you&#39;re reading this... I hope you enjoy.</p>
