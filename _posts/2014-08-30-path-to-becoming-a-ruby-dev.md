This is my path to becoming a Ruby on Rails Developer. I first was exposed to code back in June 2013, after attending a Rails Girls Workshop in Washington, DC. At that workshop, a very notable leader in the Ruby community, [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/) gave a talk on [grit](http://en.wikipedia org/wiki/Grit_%28personality_trait%29). Up until that point, I thought that being a developer was reserved for those with computer science majors and or mathmeticians. But her talk, gave me some sort of hope that if I worked hard enough, becoming a developer was possible. So with that, I set on my journey of being a self taught developer. One thing that I have learned in this process, learning to code is circular.. not linear. Often times, it may require seeing a concept 3 or 4 times before you can tackle it without googling the concept.. and what I've had to learn is that is okay. I had to let go the idea that I wasn't going to remember everything but with experience.. I could figure it out or at least know resources to leverage to find my answer. This blog is to document concepts that I've learned becasue I am bound to forget.. and that's okay. In case you're reading this... I hope you enjoy.
