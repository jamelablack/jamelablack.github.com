My name is Jam. I'm a recovering project manager with a creative knack for design, dance, and creating things. For the longest time, I've wanted a career to be super passionate about. I'd watch some of my favorite reality shows, like Project Runway, Top Chef.. etc. and be so inspired, maye even envious that they had something that they loved to do.. could do it hours on end. Rails Girls made learning to code accessible to me. . I had the pleasure of hearing[Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/) gave a talk on [grit](http://en.wikipedia org/wiki/Grit_%28personality_trait%29) - which gave me some hope that I too, if I worked hard enough, that I could approach my life's work with that same passion and creativity.

These are my daily takeways along my journey to becoming a rails dev. Hope you enjoy!
