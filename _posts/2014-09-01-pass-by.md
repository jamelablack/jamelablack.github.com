Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference:
  Pass by Value - when a method is called on an object, the variable is just representation of the value and not the actual object (the reference), itself. When called, the method can never change the object itself. To effect change to the object, you must reassgn the variable.

  In this case below, outter_str remains unchanged as a result of the method being called.
  {% highlight ruby %}

  def some_method(str)
    str.changeit
  end

  outter_str = "hi"
  some_method(outter_str)

  {% endhighlight %}
  _________________________________

  Pass by Reference - When a method is called, the object acts a pointer and a modification is actually made to an actual space in memory.

  In the case below, outter_str is just a reference (pointer) to str, therefore any mutations to str will be reflected in the value of str
  {% highlight ruby %}

  def some_method(str)
    str.changeit
  end

  outter_str = "hi"
  some_method(outter_str)

  {% endhighlight %}

  Ruby is Passing by the Reference of the Caller
  Whether or not the method creates a pass by reference or pass by reference scenario depends on whether the method mutates the caller or not
